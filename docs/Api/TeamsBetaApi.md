## `patchTeams()`

```php
patchTeams($teams_patch_input): \LaunchDarklyApi\Model\BulkEditTeamsRep
```

Update teams

Perform a partial update to multiple teams. Updating teams uses the semantic patch format.  To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).  ### Instructions  Semantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating teams.  <details> <summary>Click to expand instructions for <strong>updating teams</strong></summary>  #### addMembersToTeams  Add the members to teams.  ##### Parameters  - `memberIDs`: List of member IDs to add. - `teamKeys`: List of teams to update.  Here's an example:  ```json {   \"instructions\": [{     \"kind\": \"addMembersToTeams\",     \"memberIDs\": [       \"1234a56b7c89d012345e678f\"     ],     \"teamKeys\": [       \"example-team-1\",       \"example-team-2\"     ]   }] } ```  #### addAllMembersToTeams  Add all members to the team. Members that match any of the filters are **excluded** from the update.  ##### Parameters  - `teamKeys`: List of teams to update. - `filterLastSeen`: (Optional) A JSON object with one of the following formats:   - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.   - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.   - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds. - `filterQuery`: (Optional) A string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive. - `filterRoles`: (Optional) A `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`. - `filterTeamKey`: (Optional) A string that matches against the key of the team the members belong to. It is not case sensitive. - `ignoredMemberIDs`: (Optional) A list of member IDs.  Here's an example:  ```json {   \"instructions\": [{     \"kind\": \"addAllMembersToTeams\",     \"teamKeys\": [       \"example-team-1\",       \"example-team-2\"     ],     \"filterLastSeen\": { \"never\": true }   }] } ```  </details>
